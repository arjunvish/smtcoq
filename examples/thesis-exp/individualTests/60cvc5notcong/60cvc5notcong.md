Problem: Returned a not well-typed error until all_simplify's symmetric equality case was fixed. See #26 for the minimal problem. Seems like congruence of `not` over the symmetric `all_simplify` creates this issue. For example:
```
-----------------all_simplify
(x = y) = (y = x)
-------------------cong
!(x = y) = !(y = x)
```

Fix:

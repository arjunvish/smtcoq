The benchmarks in this directory from the Carcara paper artifact. The `artifact/sample` directory has a representative sample of 5% of the SMTLIB benchmarks 
for the theories in consideration for the paper. This directory contains only the `QF_UF` benchmarks from that sample.
The Carcara artifact also had proof files, but those have been removed.
There are 208 `.smt2` files in this benchmark set now.

We have removed all files that contain `exists` and their proofs.
Number of SMT files: 141
Number of proof files: 142

We have removed all files that contain the following rules:
qnt_cnf
sko_forall
ac_simp
onepoint
bfun_elim
qnt_simplify
and we have removed files containing Real types and forall statements.

We have no idea why there is 1 more proof file than SMT files.

To get rule count,
./countrules.sh #(outputs listOfRules)
